# GA_Unit1_Project
This repository contains all of the bits and pieces of my Unit One Project from my General Assembly Course


The title of my Unit One Project will be "Matching With Mozart"

The basic outline is this;

    1. The first screen will be a modal that will invite the user to play the game and briefly explain the rules.

    2. If the user chooses to play, the modal will disappear.
    
    3. Computer "Mozart" begins the game

    4. Once the computer finishes the sequence the user will be prompted to play back the sequence.

    5. If user plays back the sequence in the correct order, the next level initiates.

    6. If user does not play back the correct sequence, a modal will pup up stating that the game is over and prompt to play again.
